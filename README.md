# Role based access control using Spring Security & JWT

Role based access control (RBAC) means allowing or denying to perform some task 
or access to a resource based on the role of the authenticated user. 

Spring Security does 2 important things for us

Authentication: The Check to see if the given user has the right username and password.

Authorization: The Check to see if the user has enough permissions to access the API that they tried to hit.
